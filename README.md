# Indoor-hydrophonic-forming-using-k-means-clustering
This hydroponics project integrates IoT and machine learning for efficient soilless cultivation. Using sensors and ESP8266, data is monitored via ThingSpeak and an MIT App Inventor app. Automation manages water, temperature, and nutrients, while k-means clustering aids in early disease detection.
